# Twyd

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Ruby code is in the file `lib/twyd`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

Welcome to TWYD (Travel With Your Dog)! This app was made by someone who loves exploring new cities with their dog, Gretchen, in the hopes that you will keep exploring the world with your dog(s) too.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'twyd'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install twyd

## Usage

After installation, run 'twyd' in your terminal to run the program.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
